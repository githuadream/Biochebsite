<h1 class="abouttitle">Hi there ðŸ‘‹</h1>
<p class="introduction">We are a group of four from Tsinghua University, collaborating to create this website as a platform for sharing and expanding biochemistry knowledge.<br><br>

This project serves as our comprehensive homework for the Biochemistry course, where we aim to explore and present the intricate details of biochemical processes in an accessible and engaging way. The idea behind this website is not only to deepen our own understanding of biochemistry but also to provide a resource for other students, researchers, and enthusiasts who are eager to learn about the fascinating world of molecular biology, metabolic pathways, and cellular mechanisms.<br><br>

Throughout this project, each of us has taken on different responsibilities based on our strengths. From designing the website layout and user interface to collecting relevant images and creating educational videos, we have all contributed to building a cohesive and informative platform. Our goal is to make complex biochemical concepts more approachable and easier to understand, with a special focus on visual aids like pathway diagrams and interactive content. We want visitors to not only learn but also explore the dynamic nature of biochemistry through various sections dedicated to metabolism, enzymes, proteins, and more.<br><br>

This website is a reflection of our passion for biochemistry and our desire to share it with a wider audience. Whether you are a student just starting to learn about the subject or someone with more advanced knowledge, our goal is to create a space where learning biochemistry becomes a rewarding and enjoyable experience.</p>
